## Description

This repository contains frequently asked JavaScript interview questions along with hands-on exercises. These questions are commonly encountered in technical interviews. Additionally, I have created another repository that contains the most asked DSA questions mainly focused on Frontend.

## Usage

To run the files and check the outputs, follow these steps:

Install the "Live Server" extension by Ritwick Dey in VS Code.
Open the index.html file.
Right-click on the index.html file and select "Open with Live Server". (also change the src path accordingly in html file (<script src="..."></script>)for which script you want to run)
Open the console in your browser (right-click and select "Inspect", then go to the "Console" tab).
You can see and check the output of the exercises there.

Happy coding!
